and this project aspires to adhere to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

## [0.9.8] - Released 2026-09-01

### Added

#### Relay
- Added optional support for reading and writing HDF5 attributes.

#### Blueprint
- Added additional options for `conduit::blueprint::mesh::examples::venn()` allowing for the creation of a material map in all cases as well as the creation of species sets. These options were exposed in `conduit::blueprint::mesh::examples:generate()`.
- Added `conduit::blueprint::mesh::matset::has_mixed_elements()` which can determine if a material set contains any mixed elements.

### Changed

#### Blueprint
- Made `verify` for `matsets` more restrictive, rejecting matsets that include materials outside of the material map that have no volume fractions.

#### General
- Turned python on by default in `build_conduit`.
- Added `CONDUIT_PYTHONPATH`, the absolute path of Conduit's installed Python module, to Conduit's CMake config.

### Fixed

#### General
- Fixed Python unit test registration to use `Python3_EXECUTABLE` instead of `PYTHON_EXECUTABLE`. Configuring with `-DPython3_EXECUTABLE` left the old variable empty, which registered every Python test with an empty program name (`ctest` reported `Could not find executable -B`) and made those tests unrunnable.
- Fixed a case where a Python with `setuptools < 61.0.0` would silently result in empty python modules. The python modules are installed with `pip install --no-build-isolation`, so pip uses the setuptools installed in the selected python rather than the version our `pyproject.toml` files request. The exit code of the install-time `pip install` is now checked so thta pip errors don't go unnoticed, and the install is validated after the fact by ensuring the presenece of the top-level `__init__.py`.
- A setuptools bare-minimum version (`61.0.0`) is now manually enforced at configure time.

#### Blueprint
- Fixed more C++20 issues with runtime fmt params in Silo support implementation and tests.
- Fixed an issue where the `conduit::blueprint::mesh::examples::venn()` example would produce incorrect output for large radii.

#### Relay
- The `conduit::relay::mpi::safe_tag` function and its underlying logic to probe the maximum allowable MPI tag were modified to avoid `MPI_Waitall`. Tag values now use modulo above the upper limit as opposed to clamping.
- Fixed a bug with the Silo reader where material-dependent fields failed to read correctly on domains that had no mixed material elements.

## [0.9.7] - Released 2026-05-27

### Added

#### Conduit
- Added a bulk `DataAccessor::set()` method for setting many elements at once.

#### Blueprint
- Added `conduit::blueprint::mesh::rename()` helper that renames sub components of a valid mesh and their dependent references.  Example: rename a topology and ensure field topology references are updated.
- Added `conduit::blueprint::mesh::remove()` helper that removes sub components of a valid mesh and their dependencies.  Examples: remove a field by name, or remove a topology by name and any dependent entries.
- Added `conduit::blueprint::mesh::matset::get_material_names()`, which returns material names for a material set.
- Added the ability for the Partitioner to handle field `matset_values` for both domain slicing and combination.

### Fixed

#### Conduit
- Fixed an issue with fmt runtime use of a string that causes a compile error with gcc 13 and c++20.
- Add guard to prevent multiple calls of `find_package(Conduit)` from failing in downstream CMake logic. Guard logic existed in releases prior to 0.9.6, now restored.

#### Blueprint
- Fixed missing install of blueprint non-mpi mesh examples and mesh partition c++ headers.
- Handled the case in `MatsetAccessor` where a field or material set has a material that does not appear in any zones.
- Handled the case in material set transformations where a field, material set, or species set has a material that does not appear in any zones.
- Fixed bugs in `MatsetAccessor` causing copy construction to fail on Windows.

#### Relay
- Fixed a crash when reading Silo/Overlink files with missing material names.

### Changed

#### Relay
- Disabled use of HDF5 file locking.

## [0.9.6] - Released 2026-04-14

### Added

#### Conduit
- Added `CONDUIT_VERSION_VALUE` macro that encodes the current Conduit version as an integer.
- Added a macro to make an integer a version number from major, minor, patch version numbers. Example: `CONDUIT_MAKE_VERSION_VALUE(0, 9, 6)`. This macro can be used to conditionally compile code that is valid for specific versions of Conduit.
- Added `set` methods to `DataAccessor` that take `DataArrays` and `DataAccessors`.
- Added optional device execution support via RAJA and Umpire.
- Added `conduit_bin_yaml` protocol case to `Node::load()` and `Node::save()`. Also added `conduit_bin_json`, which does the same thing as `conduit_bin` (creates a json schema file to go with the `conduit_bin` file).
- Fixed an issue in `Node::swap()` or `Node::move()` where child nodes moved to a new parent did not point to their new parent. This caused operations that call `Node::parent()` to traverse upwards to malfunction.
- Added `Node::as_index_t()`. 

#### Blueprint
- Finished `bent_multi_grid_amr` mesh by adding adjacency sets between spatially adjacent domains at the same level of refinement.
- Added `conduit::blueprint::mesh::convert()` function that can convert among various mesh formats and generate derived meshes such as points, centroids, faces, sides, and corners.
- Added a mode within the new `convert()` function that allows it to convert polyhedral hex meshes into unstructured hex meshes.
- Sped up `conduit::blueprint::mesh::topology::unstructured::to_polygonal()` algorithm and added support for mixed element types.
- Improved support for "mixed" element types in  `conduit::blueprint::mesh::utils::ShapeType` and also removed a string member to speed up construction.
- Added 2D block rotation support in `conduit::blueprint::mpi::mesh::to_polygonal()`.
- Added field data to the `conduit::blueprint::mpi::mesh::to_polygonal()` transformation, including communication of vertex data on hanging nodes.
- Added `conduit::blueprint::mesh::specset::to_multi_buffer_full()`, `conduit::blueprint::mesh::specset::to_uni_buffer_by_element()`, and `conduit::blueprint::mesh::specset::to_multi_buffer_by_material()`, which are converters that take species sets between the three supported species set/material set representations.
- Added `conduit::blueprint::mesh::specset::is_multi_buffer()`, `conduit::blueprint::mesh::specset::is_uni_buffer()`, `conduit::blueprint::mesh::specset::get_num_species_for_material()`, and `conduit::blueprint::mesh::specset::get_material_names()`, which are simple species set utilities.
- Added `conduit::blueprint::mesh::matset::MatsetAccessor`, a class for fetching material set/field/species set data independent of material set layout. It provides methods that fetch data for zone id and material id pairs (or zone id, material id, species id triples).
- Added `conduit::blueprint::mesh::matset::create_or_reuse_material_map()`, which will shallow copy or create a material map for a provided material set.
- Added `conduit::blueprint::mesh::matset::create_or_copy_material_map()`, which will deep copy or create a material map for a provided material set.
- Added `conduit::blueprint::mesh::specset::create_or_reuse_species_names()`, which will shallow copy or create species names for a provided species set.
- Added `conduit::blueprint::mesh::specset::create_or_copy_species_names()`, which will deep copy or create species names for a provided species set.
- Added `conduit::blueprint::mesh::matset::renumber_material_ids()`, which renumbers material ids for a material set to be in the range 0 to N - 1, where N is the number of materials.
- Added `conduit::blueprint::mesh::matset::count_materials_from_matset()`, which counts the number of materials in a given material set, taking into account the various matset layouts.
- Added `conduit::blueprint::mesh::matset::count_materials_from_specset()`, which counts the number of materials in a given species set, taking into account the various specset layouts.
- Added `conduit::blueprint::mesh::matset::to_uni_buffer_by_material()`, `conduit::blueprint::mesh::field::to_uni_buffer_by_material()`, and `conduit::blueprint::mesh::specset::to_uni_buffer_by_material()`, which for now only throw errors, but leave the door open for future support for this 4th material set layout.

### Changed

#### Conduit
- Conduit now requires CMake 3.26 or newer.
- Updated uberenv to use Spack 1.1.1.
- Updated built in fmt to version 12.1.0.
- Updated CMake python logic to use CMake Python targets.
- Updated python module build processes to use `pyproject.toml` files. Process now requires pip `24.0.0` or newer.


#### Blueprint
- Removed previously deprecated `quads_and_tris` and `hexs_and_tets` mesh types from `braid` in `blueprint::mesh::examples`.
- Renamed `conduit::blueprint::mesh::matset::to_multi_buffer_full()` to `conduit::blueprint::mesh::matset::to_multi_buffer_by_element()`.
- Material Set conversion routines (`to_multi_buffer_by_element()`, `to_uni_buffer_by_element()`, and `to_multi_buffer_by_material()`) are now sensitive to optionally included material maps for all cases. If included, they will provide converted matsets with the material map.
- Field/Species Set conversion routines (`to_multi_buffer_by_element()`, `to_uni_buffer_by_element()`, and `to_multi_buffer_by_material()`) previously forced materials to appear in the same order in fields/specsets as they do in the associated material set. This restriction has been relaxed.
- Updated `conduit::blueprint::o2mrelation::O2MIndex` such that the number of "ones" in the one-to-many relationship is precomputed when the object is created. The number of "ones" is computed by using the `size()` method from an `O2MIndex`. If an `O2MIndex` is created but `sizes`, `offsets`, and `indices` are not present, then the `O2MIndex` constructor will examine the provided `Node` and search for data arrays to determine the number of "ones". If all data arrays in the provided `Node` have the same number of elements, then that number is assumed to be the number of "ones". If there is disagreement or there are no data arrays present, then the `O2MIndex` throws an error, as the number of "ones" is ambiguous or unknowable.
- Renamed `conduit::blueprint::mesh::matset::count_zones_from_matset()` to `conduit::blueprint::mesh::matset::count_elements_from_matset()`.
- Renamed `conduit::blueprint::mesh::matset::is_material_in_zone()` to `conduit::blueprint::mesh::matset::is_material_in_element()`.
- Added error checking for mixed vector fields (fields with `matset_values` defined on vector components). `conduit::blueprint::mesh::field::to_multi_buffer_by_element()`, `conduit::blueprint::mesh::field::to_multi_buffer_by_material()`, `conduit::blueprint::mesh::field::to_uni_buffer_by_element()`, and `conduit::blueprint::mesh::field::to_silo()` now error in this case.
- Rewrote `conduit::blueprint::mesh::matset::to_silo()`, `conduit::blueprint::mesh::field::to_silo()`, and `conduit::blueprint::mesh::specset::to_silo()`. Instead of just the `specset` case having its own implementation, all three now share a common implementation. Additionally, support for multi-buffer by material and uni-buffer by element `specsets` have come online as part of these changes. We have also removed support for non-idiomatic material-set representations. Most importantly, the new version of `to_silo()` boasts significant speedup: for multi-buffer by element `matset/fields`, the new version is roughly 15x faster, depending on how large your data is. For multi-buffer by material `matset/fields`, the new version has a modest speedup of roughly 1.05x. For uni-buffer by element `matset/fields`, the speedup ratio increases as the problem size increases. For even trivially sized problems, the speedup is roughly 100x, while for million-element problems the speedup is many times greater than 1000x. Speedup information for `specsets` is omitted as support was previously limited to multi-buffer by element `specsets`.
- Modified `conduit::blueprint::mpi::mesh::generate_partition_field()` so it takes a "verbose" option, which is set to 0 (off) by default. This change of behavior results in less output while still giving the user the ability to generate verbose Parmetis output.
- Changed logic in `matset` `verify` such that for multi-buffer material sets, children of `volume_fractions` must be a subset of children of the `material_map`, not the other way around.
- Removed support for the multi-buffer `matset` indirection case in which children of `volume_fractions` could be `o2mrelations` instead of flat arrays.

#### Relay
- Updates to use Silo 4.12 and HDF5 2.0.0.
- Reworked HDF5 handle managment to avoid resource leaks with exceptions.
- Relaxed the restriction on float and double volume fractions for data being read from Silo when the length of the mixed arrays is 0 (i.e. no mixed zones/volume fractions are present).
- Adjusted MPI max tag logic search for cases where large tags are supported.
- Added logic to enforce Overlink requirements when writing species sets to Overlink files.


### Fixed

#### Conduit
- Fixed a bug preventing explicit length 0 in `yaml` schema.
- Fixed a bug where empty objects or lists were not written correctly to `yaml` schema.
- Fixed a bug where the python DataType constructor did not properly accept arguments.

#### Blueprint
- Fixed an issue with material set conversions where uni-buffer by material matsets would incorrectly follow the same path as multi-buffer by material matsets.
- Fixed `conduit::blueprint::mesh::utils::topology::compute_mesh_info()` so it does not generate a floating point exception when processing 1-d meshes under the Intel 25 compiler with C++20.
- Modified all material set transforms and helper functions to make them robust to all 4 material set layout types.
- Fixed a bug with the `conduit::blueprint::mesh::partition()` partitioner where providing multi-buffer element-dominant material sets yielded malformed multi-buffer material-dominant resulting material sets.
- Fixed a bug with `conduit::blueprint::mesh::matset::count_elements_from_matset()` where uni-buffer by element-matsets with a trivial one-to-many relationship would throw an error instead of correctly computing the number of elements.

#### Relay
- Fixed a bug preventing multiple species sets from being written when writing to Overlink.
- Fixed an issue where `int64` unstructured topology connectivity information would cause The Silo writer to crash.

## [0.9.5] - Released 2025-09-10

### Added

#### Blueprint
- Added support for unstructured topologies with `mixed` shape type in the `conduit::blueprint::mesh::partition()` and `conduit::blueprint::mesh::utils::topology::iterate_elements()` functions. They work with mixed shape types, including polyhedra.
- Added `conduit::blueprint::mesh::utils::topology::compute_mesh_info()` function to compute basic information about a mesh such as extents and edge lengths.
- Added `conduit::blueprint::mesh::utils::topology::Quantizer` class to compute a quantized index for a point.
- Added `bent_multi_grid_amr` example mesh.  This enhances the `bent_multi_grid` example to allow a user to specify, in one of the domains, a nested domain with its ID and refinement ratio.  This will allow example AMR meshes.

#### Relay
- Added `flush` method to `relay::IOHandle` interface. Semantics differ between concrete implementations.
- Added `flush` support to `relay::BasicIOHandle`, allows write to file system without closing the handle.
- Added `flush` support to `relay::HDF5Handle`, if hdf5 file handle is open, invokes `H5Fflush()` with `H5F_SCOPE_LOCAL`.
- Added namescheme read and write support to the Relay Silo/Overlink Reader/Writer.
- Added support for block types or unified types to the Relay Silo/Overlink Reader/Writer.

### Changed

#### General
- Updates to spack uberenv recipes for macOS 15.5.

#### Blueprint
- The `conduit::blueprint::mesh::topology::dims()` function was changed so it will return the maximum topological dimension of the shape types from the `shape_map` for a `mixed` shape.
- Enhanced the `conduit::blueprint::mesh::examples::tiled()` function so it can accept mesh tiles containing `mixed` shape types for generating 2D tiled output.
- Adjacency set construction was altered so points are sorted spatially using the `Quantizer` class.

### Fixed
#### Relay
- Fixed an issue with the Overlink Writer preventing it from correctly writing out data in the n files to m domains case.


## [0.9.4] - Released 2025-04-03

### Added
#### Conduit

- Added an example demonstrating a strategy to use Umpire with Conduit's allocators.
- Added `conduit::utils::memory_usage` helper.
- Added extra unit tests for native signed and unsigned Node set methods.
- Added support to read a `HOST_CONFIG` environment variable to allow `pip` installs. When set, pip install will pass a host config file to set CMake options.

#### Blueprint
- Added `conduit::blueprint::<mpi>::mesh::state()`, `conduit::blueprint::<mpi>::mesh::cycle()`, and `conduit::blueprint::<mpi>::mesh::time()`, utilities for getting state information from meshes.
- Added `conduit.blueprint.mpi`, `conduit.blueprint.mpi.mesh`, and `conduit.blueprint.mpi.mesh.examples` modules to the Python interface.

#### Relay
- Added h5z-zfp compression support to relay io hdf5 methods.
- Added `conduit::relay::<mpi>::io::blueprint::generate_root_filename()`, which takes the same arguments as `save_mesh` or `write_mesh` and produces the name of the root file that would be generated by a call to `save_mesh` or `write_mesh`.
- Added `conduit::relay::mpi::memory_usage` and `conduit::relay::mpi::memory_stats` helpers.
- Added `conduit.relay.mpi.io` and `conduit.relay.mpi.io.blueprint` modules to the Python interface.
- Added `v1120` and `v1140` options to hdf5 libver settings to support 1.12 and 1.14 libver upper range.

### Changed
#### Conduit
- Updated build system to use blt 0.7.0.
- Changed Conduit memory handler callbacks from function pointers to `std::function` objects, allowing users more flexibility in dealing with different memory spaces.
- Adjusted how imported CMake target `conduit::conduit_python` locates python headers for case where Conduit's python module is installed as part of the overall conduit install.

#### Relay
- Ported relay and blueprint zfp support to use zfp 1.0 api. Added extra meta data to zfparray blueprint protocol to support roundtrip wrapping and unwrapping with zfp 1.0 api.
- Added `conduit::relay::mpi::memory_usage` and `conduit::relay::mpi::memory_stats` helpers.

### Fixed

#### Relay
- Fixed an issue with the relay hdf5 detection heuristic on windows.
- Fixed a bug with path creation logic that impact reading mesh blueprint data on windows.

## [0.9.3] - Released 2025-01-27

### Added

#### Conduit
- Added `conduit_yaml` and `conduit_base64_yaml` protocol support.
- Added support to detect `.yml` files as `yaml` protocol.

#### Blueprint
- Added `conduit::blueprint::mesh::examples:generate` driver functions that supports creating any blueprint example mesh with options.
- Added `conduit::blueprint::mesh::examples:generate_default_options` functions that provide default options values for `conduit::blueprint::mesh::examples:generate`.
- Added python API support for `conduit::blueprint::mesh::examples:generate` and `conduit::blueprint::mesh::examples:generate_default_options`.
- Added `gyre` example mesh, which provides a simple velocity vector field.
- Added `bent_multi_grid` example mesh, which provides a multi-grid that can contain enhanced and reduced connectivity.  `bent_multi_grid` can produce meshes like the example at http://visitusers.org/index.php?title=Representing_ghost_data#Enhanced_and_Reduced_Connectivity_Zones .
- Added new utilities for material sets: `conduit::blueprint::mesh::matset::count_zones_from_matset()`, `conduit::blueprint::mesh::matset::is_material_in_zone()`, and `conduit::blueprint::mesh::matset::create_reverse_material_map()`.
- Added a new example, `conduit::blueprint::mesh::examples::venn_specsets()`, which covers the breadth of species set representations.

#### Relay
- Added limited support for species sets for Silo/Overlink I/O. Multi-buffer element-dominant species sets can be written to Silo and the same can be read from Silo. Additional species set flavors will come online in a later release.
- Added support for `conduit_yaml` and `conduit_base64_yaml` I/O cases.
- Standardized the way that Relay Silo Save handles name collisions and non-idiomatic Silo names.

### Changed

#### Conduit
- Changed the MPI CMake target used by conduit from `MPI:MPI_CXX` to `MPI:MPI_C` to provide better compatibility with downstream tools.
- Added vendored yyjson v0.10.0 as new and default JSON parser. yyjson has an MIT license that is compatible with Debian's Free Software Guidelines, where RapidJSON is not  (https://wiki.debian.org/qa.debian.org/jsonevil). You can still use RapidJSON by setting the new CMake option `ENABLE_YYJSON` to `FALSE`.
- The `DataType::equals()` method now correctly takes striding into account.

#### Blueprint
- Certain algorithms that use MPI tags had their tag values lowered since some MPI implementations do not support large values.
- Changed the name of `conduit::blueprint::mesh::matset::to_sparse_by_element()` to `conduit::blueprint::mesh::matset::to_uni_buffer_by_element()` to be more consistent with similar function names.
- Expanded the ways species sets can be represented in Blueprint to include sparse by element and sparse by material representations, much like material sets.
- Updated `conduit.relay.io.blueprint.{load_mesh|read_mesh}` to support reading and writing Silo files when Conduit is built with Silo support.
- Updated `conduit.relay.io.blueprint.{load_mesh|read_mesh}` to use improved logic to auto detect the format (hdf5 , silo, yaml, or json) of mesh blueprint root files. Added silo logic, and fixed prior logic that could confuse yaml as json files due to format specifiers in partition pattern strings.

#### Relay
- User-supplied warning and error handlers are suspended during `conduit::relay::communicate_using_schema::execute()` so exceptions will be thrown properly when there is an MPI error. The handlers are restored before the execute method returns.
- `conduit::relay::communicate_using_schema::execute()` flushes logs as they are generated, in case of error. This is mostly to facilitate internal debugging.
- Changes were made to how Relay queries the upper limit for MPI tags to work around problems on some systems.
- Rewrote `conduit::blueprint::mesh::specset::to_silo()` to allow it to support specsets that do not use all the materials in the associated matset.

## [0.9.2] - Released 2024-05-21

### Added

#### Conduit
- Added support for YAML schema.

#### Relay
- Added support for Blueprint + Silo round trip for axis units and labels.
- Added support for reading Silo column major data as strided structured Blueprint data.
- Added support for reading a much wider set of Silo meshes, beyond multimeshes, multivars, etc.

### Changed

#### Conduit
- Removed cmake use of distutils for python introspection.

#### Blueprint
- Fixed partitioner so it reverses vertex order as needed in polyhedral face definitions when extracting mesh elements.
- Changed `conduit::blueprint::mesh::partition_map_back()` function so it will attempt to reuse existing field memory when mapping fields back. This permits `partition_map_back()` to send data from a partitioned mesh into the original mesh where fields were provided from a host code using `Node::set_external()`.
- Changed `generate_sides` to be robust to the case where no fields exist.
- Deprecated braid `quads_and_tris` example in favor of `mixed_2d`.
- Deprecated braid `braid_quads_and_tris_offsets` example in favor of `mixed_2d`.
- Deprecated braid `hexs_and_tris` example in favor of `mixed`.

#### Relay
- Changed `conduit::relay::mpi::communicate_using_schema` to avoid an invalid tag MPI error message on some MPI distributions.

### Fixed

#### Relay
- Fixed Relay I/O HDF5 DataSpace handle leak.

## [0.9.1] - Released 2024-02-09

### Changed

#### Conduit
- Relaxed strict header check for C++14 back to C++11. A downstream consumer of Conduit has C++11 hardcoded into their build system and patching for related deployments is intractable.
- Restore logic to avoid fused mpi c++ and fortran flags that can undermine blt's mpi smoke test.


#### Blueprint
- Fixed missing build dependency relationship with the python conduit blueprint table examples module.
- Fixed partitioner so it does not duplicate faces when combining polyhedral meshes.

### Added

#### Relay
- Added polygonal support to Blueprint Silo I/O.

## [0.9.0] - Released 2024-02-05

### Added

#### General
- Added `conduit_json_external` protocol. Creates a json schema representation of a node that includes all addresses that the node is pointing to. Parsing this schema will create a node equivalent to `set_external()`.
- Added a `conduit_generate_data` executable that can generate datasets using the `tiled()` and `braid()` functions and save the datasets to files.
- Added helpers that support enhanced debugging of Conduit Node objects in several debuggers.
- Added the ability to set values via a DataAccessor and DataAccessor to string methods.
- Added explicit set methods to DataArray, and the ability to set DataArray values from a DataAccessor.


#### Relay
- Added extensive Mesh Blueprint Silo I/O support including, including options for Overlink Silo conventions. This capability allows Silo files to be used as a close peer to the Blueprint HDF5 I/O options.
- Added ability to read N-dimensional hyperslabs from HDF5 leaf arrays into linear memory arrays.
- Added `conduit.relay.io.silo` to the Python interface.

#### Blueprint
- Added a `conduit::blueprint::mesh::examples::tiled()` function that can generate meshes by repeating a tiled pattern.
- Added a `conduit::blueprint::mpi::mesh::utils::adjset::compare_pointwise()` function that can compare adjsets for multi-domain meshes in parallel. The function is used to diagnose adjsets with points that are out of order on either side of the boundary. The comparison is done point by point within each group and it checks to ensure that the points reference the same spatial location.
- Added a `conduit::blueprint::mesh::utils::reorder()` function that can accept a vector of element ids and create a reordered topology. The points and coordinates are re-ordered according to their first use in the new element ordering.
- Added a `conduit::blueprint::mesh::utils::topology::spatial_ordering()` function that takes a topology and computes centroids for each element, passes them through a kdtree, and returns the new element ordering. The new ordering can be used with the `reorder()` function.
- Added a `conduit::blueprint::mesh::utils::topology::hilbert_ordering()` function that computes a new order for a topology's elements based on their centroids and a Hilbert curve. The new ordering can be used with the `reorder()` function.
- Added a `conduit::blueprint::mesh::utils::slice_array()` function that can slice Conduit nodes that contain arrays. A new node with the same type is created but it contains only the selected indices.
- Added a `conduit::blueprint::mesh::utils::slice_field()` function. It is like `slice_array()` but it can handle the mcarray protocol. This functionality was generalized from the partitioner.
- Added a `conduit::blueprint::mesh::utils::topology::unstructured::rewrite_connectivity()` function that will rewrite a topology's connectivity in terms of a different coordset. The PointQuery is used internally to search for equivalent coordinates in the new coordset.
- Added a `conduit::blueprint::mesh::utils::copy_fields()` function that helps copy fields from one fields node to another.
- Added a `conduit::blueprint::mesh::utils::convert()` function that converts a list of nodes to a desired data type.
- Added a `conduit::blueprint::mesh::generate_boundary_partition_field()` function that can take a topology and a partition field and generate a field for a related boundary topology. This is helpful when partitioning a boundary topology in the same manner as its parent topology.
- Added `blueprint.mesh.examples.strided_structured` to the blueprint python module.
- Added `conduit::blueprint::mesh::utils::adjset::to_topo()` function to make new point mesh topologies for each group of an adjacency set. This permits each group to be visualized as a set of points in VisIt. The groups for each side of the domain interface can be compared since they are separate point meshes.
- Added `conduit::blueprint::mesh::utils::adjset::is_canonical()` function to check whether the group names in an adjacency set are canonical.
- Added more Mesh Blueprint docs.

### Changed

#### General
- Conduit now requires C++14 and CMake 3.21 or newer.
- Improved the efficiency of json parsing logic.
- The `conduit_relay_io_convert` program was enhanced so it can read/write Blueprint root files by passing _"blueprint"_ for the read or write protocols.
- The `conduit_adjset_validate` program now writes a point mesh for each adjset groups if the `-output` argument is supplied.
- Updated to BLT 0.6.1
- Updated Python logic hybrid module build logic to use pip and setuptools. Removed use of distutils.

#### Blueprint
- The `conduit::blueprint::mpi::mesh::partition_map_back()` function was enhanced so it accepts a "field_prefix" value in its options. The prefix is used when looking for the `global_vertex_ids` field, which could have been created with a prefix by the same option in the `conduit::blueprint::mpi::mesh::generate_partition_field()` function.
- The `conduit::blueprint::mesh::utils::ShapeType` class was enhanced so it can take topologies other than unstructured.
- The `conduit::blueprint::mesh::utils::topology::unstructured::points()` function was changed so it takes an optional argument that can turn off point uniqueness and sorting so the method can return points for an element as they appear in the connectivity, for non-polyhedral shapes.
- Removed deprecated use of `npts_z !=0` for 2D shape types in `conduit::blueprint::mesh::examples::{braid,basic,grid}`. These cases now issue a `CONDUIT_ERROR`.
- Removed `volume_dependent` entry in `specsets`. Species ratios and mass fractions are innately volume independent.

#### Relay
- Relay Mesh Blueprint I/O methods (`conduit::relay::io::blueprint::{save,write}_mesh()``) now default to `hdf5` protocol if Conduit is built with `hdf5` support.

### Fixed

#### General
- The Fortran `node` procedures for fetching integer pointers are now associated with the correct routines.

#### Blueprint
- The `conduit::blueprint::mesh::partition()` function no longer issues an error when it receives a "maxshare" adjset.
- The partitioner is better about outputting a "material_map" node for matsets. The "material_map" node is optional for some varieties of matset but they can also help the `conduit::blueprint::mesh::matset::to_silo()` function generate the right material numbers when a domain does not contain all materials.
- The `conduit::Node::swap()` and `conduit::Node::move()` functions no longer cause node names to disappear.
- The `conduit::blueprint::mesh::utils::kdtree` could erroneously return that points were not found when one of the coordset dimensions had a very narrow range of values. This could happen with planar 2D geometries embedded in 3D, such as inside a `MatchQuery` during adjacency set creation.
- The `conduit::blueprint::mpi::mesh::generate_partition_field()` function was not treating polyhedral topologies correctly, leading to unusable partitioning fields.
- The point merging algorithm in the Blueprint partitioner was corrected so it should no longer produce occasional duplicate points when merging coordsets.

## [0.8.8] - Released 2023-05-18

### Added

#### General
- Added Python 3 Stable ABI compatibility (Py_LIMITED_API) build support. Enabled by default when building against Python 3.11 or newer.
- Added `conduit_adjset_validate` tool which can read root files for a multiple domain dataset and check whether the adjsets (vertex or element associations) in it are correct. Any errors are printed to the console.

#### Blueprint
- Added `PointQuery` class that can query points in a topology and return whether the query points hit a point in that topology's coordset. There are serial and parallel versions of this class. In parallel, the query domain may exist on a different MPI rank and the result will be communicated to the calling rank.
- Added `MatchQuery` class that can be used to ask remote domains whether they contain an entity given using a set of point ids in the current rank's topology. The query builds up a query topology that it sends to the neighboring rank (if the query domain is not owned by the current MPI rank) and the topology is matched against the remote topology by matching points in the remote coordset. The results are returned to the calling MPI rank and can be retrieved using the query.
- Added `TopologyBuilder` class that can be used to build up a new topology subset from a source topology. The new topology shape does not have to match the original topology shape. A new coordset is created based on the points that are referenced from the original topology.
- Added `topology::search` function that allows one topology to be searched for in another topology. The topologies must have the same shape type and their respective coordsets can have points in different orders. The shapes are matched using coordinate matching.
- Added `adjset::validate` function which tests adjacency sets for correctness and flags any errors in a Conduit node. There are serial and parallel versions of the function. The functions apply PointQuery for vertex association adjsets and MatchQuery for element association adjsets. Each domain's adjset will make queries to its neighboring domains as to whether the vertex or element of interest exists in the neighbor's topology.
- Added `utils::kdtree` class that can be used to accelerate point lookups for coordsets.
- Field selections for the `conduit::blueprint::mesh::partition()` function support a new `destination_ranks` property that contains a list of integers that map domain numbers to MPI ranks. This property tells the partitioner the ranks where it should place each domain. If the property is not supplied, the partitioner is free to place domains as before.

### Fixed

#### General
- Added explicit control for OpenMP Features with CMake `ENABLE_OPENMP` option (default = OFF). Adds `CONDUIT_USE_OPENMP` define to `conduit_config.h`. Guards all use of OpenMP with `CONDUIT_USE_OPENMP`. Prior to these guards, downstream users could enable OpenMP and macros could evaluate inconsistently with how Conduit was built causing OpenMP related linking errors.

#### Blueprint
- Functions such as `generate_corners` or `generate_faces` that accept adjsets now include a filtering stage to improve adjset quality. This filtering stage uses `PointQuery` and `MatchQuery` to ensure that entities referenced in a remote domain actually exist in the neighboring domain.

## [0.8.7] - Released 2023-03-23

### Added

#### General
- Added public default and copy constructor to DataAccessor. Enables more flexibility with initializing DataAccessors from Nodes.
- Added Node.name(), Node.path(), Schema.name(), and Schema.path() to Python API.
- Added Node.as_index_t_ptr()
- Added `conduit::execution` namespace, which contains `for_all()` and `sort()` functions.
- Added DataType support to the Fortran API

#### Blueprint
- Added `conduit::blueprint::mpi::mesh::distribute`, which enables sending mesh domains to arbitrary MPI ranks (suppo
- Added `conduit::blueprint::mesh::utils::NDIndex` class.  Instantiate with shape, offset, and stride in array or conduit::Node.  Get flatindex for N-D coordinates.
- Added `conduit::blueprint::o2mrelation::O2MIndex` class.  Instantiate with O2M relation Node; get flatindex for a given one_index and many_index.  Alternative to Java-style iterator.
- Added `conduit::blueprint::examples::mesh::rz_cylinder` function that generates example 2D cylindrical (RZ) meshes.

#### Relay
- Added verbose mode option for Relay I/O HDF5 diagnostic messages. See `src/tests/relay/t_relay_io_hdf5_diag_verbose.cpp` for an example of how to enable verbose output.

### Fixed
#### General
- Fixed a logic issue undermining C++ type mapping when using CMake 3.26.

#### Blueprint
- Performance improvements to Mesh Blueprint topology metadata, used by `generate_points`, `generate_sides`, etc. The class was rewritten and the old one was moved to `conduit::blueprint::mesh::utils::reference::TopologyMetadata`. The new implementation is faster, often about 6-20x depending on options.
- Performance improvements to O2M Iterators.
- Performance improvements to functions that underpin centroid generation.

#### Relay
- Fixed MPI baton logic error in `conduit::relay::io::blueprint::save_mesh()` that caused MPI tasks to serialize writes to files in the N domains to M files case. Fix restores parallel write performance. This bug did not impact cases where where N domains were written to N files (N to N) or N domains were written to a single file (N to 1).

### Changed
#### General
- Changed diff of string types to respect null terminated strings instead of described length
- Improved diff_compatible of string types to look for substring match, to implement expected compatible semantics.

#### Blueprint
- Changed the recommended axis order for 2D cylindrical meshes to be `Z` as the first axis, and `R` as the second. This choice aligns with expected visualization cases where `Z` varies with the horizontal axis and `R` varies with the vertical axis.


## [0.8.6] - Released 2023-01-11

### Added

#### General
- Added C++ `int DataType::sizeof_index_t()` and C `int conduit_datatype_sizeof_index_t()` methods to provide a stable ABI to determine configured size (number of bytes) of Conduit's index_t type.

### Fixed

#### General
- Build fixes for Conda Forge (mpi -fallow-argument-mismatch clang protection)

#### Relay
- Fixed a directory creation bug in `relay::io::blueprint::{save_mesh|write_mesh}` that occurred with sparse topologies with no domains on rank 0.
- Fixed a bug in `relay::io::blueprint::{save_mesh|write_mesh}` with the `suffix=cycle` option that could cause int max to erroneously be used as the cycle number in the output directory.


## [0.8.5] - Released 2022-12-22

### Added
#### General
- Added Node::move and Node::swap methods, which provide efficient ways to help build Node trees by consuming other Nodes.
- Added Node::reset methods to C and Fortran interfaces.
- Added initial optional support for Caliper performance annotations.
- Added Python support for `Node.set` and `Node.set_external` with a schema and external buffer.

#### Blueprint
- Added support for Wedges and Pyramids.
- Added helper function `blueprint::mesh::generate_strip` to generate a 2D "strip mesh" topology, and dependent other Blueprint mesh parts, from a 1D mesh.

### Changed
#### General
- Changed `Schema::has_path()` (and transitively `Node::has_path()` ) to ignore leading `/` s.
- Updated to BLT v0.5.2

#### Relay
- When using HDF5 1.10 or newer, default to use libver 1.8 when creating HDF5 files for wider read compatibly. This setting can be controlled via the hdf5 relay option `libver`, accepted values: `default`, `none`, `latest`, `v108`, and `v110`.


#### Relay
- Updated C++ and Python tutorial docs for Compatible Schemas with a new example to outline the most common use case.

### Fixed

#### Blueprint
- Fixed bug with `blueprint::mesh::examples::strided_structured` so it correctly generates a coordset with padding
- Fixes (correctness and performance) to `topology::unstructured::generate_offsets`
- Updated `conduit.relay.io.blueprint.{load_mesh|read_mesh}` to use improved logic to auto detect the format (hdf5 ,yaml, or json) of mesh blueprint root files.
- Leading `/` s in mesh tree paths no longer undermine `conduit.relay.io.blueprint.{load_mesh|read_mesh}` reading json and yaml flavored files.
- Fixed indexing and offsets in blueprint mixed element topology examples.

#### Relay
- Leading `/` s in tree paths no longer undermine io::IOHandle reads for conduit_bin, json, conduit_json, conduit_base64_json, and yaml flavored files.
- Updated `conduit.relay.io.blueprint.{load_mesh|read_mesh}` to only the read the necessary subset of root file entries. Updated MPI version to only read root file entries on rank 0 and broadcast them to other ranks.
- Fixed write compatibly check in `relay::mpi::gather`, `relay::mpi::all_gather`, and `relay::mpi::broadcast_using_schema`. Node compatible check is not commutative and checks in leaf zero-copy logic were reversed.


## [0.8.4] - Released 2022-08-22

### Added
#### General
- Added variants of `Node::to_json`, `Node::to_yaml`, and `Node::to_string` that take formatting options via a Conduit Node.
- Added C API methods `conduit_node_to_json`, `conduit_node_to_yaml`, `conduit_node_to_string`, and `conduit_node_to_summary_string`.
- Added `DataArray::count` method.
- Added `DataAccessor::{min,max,sum,mean,count}` methods.
- Added Schema and Python Buffer variants to Python `Node.set()` and `Node.set_external()`.

#### Blueprint
- Added `blueprint::mesh::paint_adjset`, which paints fields that encode adjacency set counts and ordering details.
- Added `blueprint::mesh::examples::strided_structured` which creates a structured mesh with arbitrarily strided vertex and element fields.
- Added support for mixed element topologies to the mesh blueprint.
- Added `blueprint::mesh::examples::braid` examples with mixed element topologies (`mesh_type={"mixed", "mixed_2d"}`)
- Added 1D mesh example support to `blueprint::mesh::examples::basic()`.
- Added adjacency set aware generate functions (`genearte_points()`, etc) to the non-mpi blueprint library.
- Added `generate_offsets_inline(Node &)` for cases where we want topology offsets created in an existing tree.
- Added support to write and read per-mesh blueprint index entires with `partition_pattern` and `partition_map`.



#### Relay
- Added any source, any tag variants of mpi receive functions: `recv`, `recv_using_schema`, and `irecv`.
- Added subpath support for `relay::io::{save,load,save_merged,load_merged}` for basic protocols (json, yaml, etc).

### Changed

#### Blueprint
- Removed field `type` entries from braid examples, since that info is not required by the Mesh Blueprint.
- Fixed a const-ignoring crime related to polyhedral element and subelement offset generation.
- Refactored unstructured case in `blueprint::mesh::topology::logical_dims` calculation to directly calculate number of elements instead of generating offsets.

#### Relay
- Changed HDF5 CMake sanity checks to issue `WARNING` instead of `FATAL_ERROR`, since Cray system HDF5 installs do not always present the info we use for sanity checks.
- Changed HDF5 version guards to also check requested HDF5 API.


### Fixed

#### General
- Fixed bug with `to_json()` where leaf arrays of size 0 lead to malformed json.
- Fixed parsing issue with `conduit_json` protocol for leaf arrays of size 0.
- Fixed roundtrip parsing of numeric arrays with nan, infs, etc for JSON cases (`Node::to_json()` followed by `Node::parse(...,"json")`).

#### Blueprint
- Fixed a bug with `blueprint::mesh::index::generate`, where a uniform grid with no origin would lead to invalid coordinate system name `logical` in the resulting index. This case now defaults to `cartesian`.
- Improved `relay::io::blueprint::{save_mesh|write_mesh}` blueprint index generation for cases where fields do not exist on all domains.
- Fixed a bug that labeled internal faces as shared in generated adjsets.

#### Relay
- Fixed a bug with blueprint root file creation, where the `file_pattern` was not relative to the root file location
- Fixed missing header include for relay io csv support.
- Fixed a bug with relay mpi all reduce.

## [0.8.3] - Released 2022-04-14

### Added

#### General
- Added C/C++ version macros `CONDUIT_VERSION_MAJOR`, `CONDUIT_VERSION_MINOR`, `CONDUIT_VERSION_PATCH` and these values as separate entries in `conduit::about()` to provide more support for compile time and runtime conduit version detection.


#### Blueprint
- Added `blueprint::mesh::examples::polystar`, which creates a mesh with a polyhedral star pattern that demonstrates hanging vertices in a topology, along with its representations from `generate_sides` and `generate_corners`.
- Added `blueprint::mesh::examples::related_boundary`, which creates a multi-domain mesh with a related boundary topology and several fileds that encode relationships between the main topology and the boundary.
- Expanded `blueprint::mpi::mesh::generate_partition_field` to support all topology types.


### Fixed

#### Blueprint
- Fixed a bug with `conduit::blueprint::mesh::examples::braid`, where 2D cases for points and structured examples would create coordsets with all entries being zero.

### Changed

#### General
- Improved pip install logic

#### Relay
- Added szip and zlib linking fix for older version of HDF5 (1.8.14)
- Fixed a bug with `relay::io::blueprint::write_mesh` and `relay::io::blueprint::save_mesh` for the multi domain case, removing unintended `:mesh` file name suffix for json and yaml domain files.

## [0.8.2] - Released 2022-02-01

### Fixed

#### Blueprint
- Fixed missing C++ include used by Blueprint Parmetis support.

## [0.8.1] - Released 2022-01-25

### Added
#### General
- Added `CONDUIT_DLL_DIR` env var support on windows, for cases where Conduit DLLs are not installed directly inside the Python Module.

#### Blueprint
- Allow adjsets to be used in `blueprint::mesh::partition` to determine global vertex ids.
- Added partial matset support to `blueprint::mesh::partition` and `blueprint::mesh::combine`.

### Fixed

#### General
- Fixed CMake bug with `ENABLE_RELAY_WEBSERVER` option.
- Fixed build and test issues with Python >= 3.8  on Windows.

#### Blueprint
- Fixed a bug in `blueprint::mesh::partition` where adjsets could be missing in new domains.
- Fixed a bug with `blueprint::mesh::matset::to_silo` and uni-buffer matsets.


## [0.8.0] - Released 2021-12-20


### Added

#### General
- Added `setup.py` for building and installing Conduit and its Python module via pip
- Added DataAccessor class that helps write generic algorithms that consume data arrays using expected types.
- Added support to register custom memory allocators and a custom data movement handler. This allows conduit to move trees of data between heterogenous memory spaces (e.g. CPU and GPU memory). See conduit_utils.hpp for API details.

#### Blueprint
- Added `conduit::blueprint::{mpi}::partition` function that provides a general N-to-M partition capability for Blueprint Meshes. This helps with load balancing and other use cases, including fusing multi-domain data to simplifying post processing. This capability supports several options, see (https://llnl-conduit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blueprint_mesh_partition.html) for more details.
- Added a `Table` blueprint used to represent tables of numeric data. See (https://llnl-conduit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blueprint_table.html) more details.
- Added `conduit::blueprint::{mpi}::flatten` which transforms Blueprint Meshes into Blueprint Tables. This transforms Mesh Blueprint data into a form that is more easily digestible in machine learning applications.
- Added `conduit::blueprint::mpi::generate_partition_field`, which uses Parmetis to create a field that identifies how to load balance an input mesh elements.  This field can be used as a Field selection input to `conduit::blueprint::mpi::partition` function.
- Added the`blueprint::mesh::examples::polychain` example. It is an example of a polyhedral mesh. See Mesh Blueprint Examples docs (https://llnl-conduit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blueprint_mesh.html#polychain) for more details.
- Added a new function signature for `blueprint::mesh::topology::unstructured::generate_sides`, which performs the same task as the original and also takes fields from the original topology and maps them onto the new topology.
- Added `blueprint::mpi::mesh::to_polygonal`, which provides a MPI aware conversion Blueprint Structured AMR meshes to a Blueprint Polyhedral meshes.
- Added a host of `conduit::blueprint::mpi::mesh::generate_*` methods, which are the MPI parallel equivalents of the `conduit::blueprint::mesh::topology::unstructured::generate_*` functions.
- Added the `conduit::blueprint::mpi::mesh::find_delegate_domain` function, which returns a single delegate domain for the given mesh across MPI ranks (useful when all ranks need mesh information and some ranks can have empty meshes).
- Added check and transform functions for the newly-designated `pairwise` and `maxshare` variants of `adjsets`. For more information, see the `conduit::blueprint::mesh::adjset` namespace.
- Added `mesh::topology::unstructured::to_polytopal` as an alias to `mesh::topology::unstructured::to_polygonal`, to reflect that both polygonal and polyhedral are supported.
- Added `conduit::blueprint::mpi::mesh::to_polytopal` as an alias to `conduit::blueprint::mpi::mesh::to_polygonal` and `conduit::blueprint::mpi::mesh::to_polyhedral`.


#### Relay
- Added `conduit::relay::io::hdf5_identifier_report` methods, which create conduit nodes that describes active hdf5 resource handles.


### Changed

#### General
- Updated CMake logic to provide more robust Python detection and better support for HDF5 installs that were built with CMake.
- Improved Node::diff and Node::diff_compatible to show string values when strings differ.
- `conduit::Node::print()` and in Python Node `repr` and `str` now use `to_summary_string()`. This reduces the output for large Nodes. Full output is still supported via `to_string()`, `to_yaml()`, etc methods.

#### Blueprint
- The `blueprint::mesh::examples::polytess` function now takes a new argument, called `nz`, which allows it to be extended into 3 dimensions. See Mesh Blueprint Examples docs (https://llnl-conduit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blueprint_mesh.html#polytess) for more details.
- Added support for both `const` and non-`const` inputs to the `conduit::blueprint::mesh::domains` function.
- Improved mesh blueprint index generation logic (local and MPI) to support domains with different topos, fields, etc.
- Deprecated accepting `npts_z !=0` for 2D shape types in `conduit::blueprint::mesh::examples::{braid,basic,grid}`. They issue a `CONDUIT_INFO` message when this detected and future versions will issue a `CONDUIT_ERROR`.
- An empty Conduit Node is now considered a valid multi-domain mesh. This change was made to make serial uses cases better match sparse MPI multi-domain use cases. Existing code that relied `mesh::verify` to exclude empty Nodes will now need an extra check to see if an input mesh has data.
- Added MPI communicator argument to `conduit::blueprint::mpi::mesh::to_polygonal` and `conduit::blueprint::mpi::mesh::to_polyhedral`.



#### Relay
- Added CMake option (`ENABLE_RELAY_WEBSERVER`, default = `ON`) to control if Conduit's Relay Web Server support is built. Down stream codes can check for support via header ifdef `CONDUIT_RELAY_WEBSERVER_ENABLED` or at runtime in `conduit::relay::about`.
- Added support to compile against HDF5 1.12.

### Fixed

#### General
- Avoid compile issue with using `_Pragma()` with Python 3.8 on Windows
- `conduit_node` and `conduit_datatype` in the C API are no longer aliases to `void` so that callers cannot pass just any pointer to the APIs.
- Fixed memory over read issue with Fortran API due to int vs bool binding error. Fortran API still provides logical returns for methods like conduit_node_has_path() however the binding implementation now properly translates C_INT return codes into logical values.
- Fixed a subtle bug with Node fetch and Object role initialization.

#### Blueprint
- Fixed a bug that was causing the `conduit::blueprint::mesh::topology::unstructured::generate_*` functions to produce bad results for polyhedral input topologies with heterogeneous elements (e.g. tets and hexs).
- Fixed a bug with `conduit::relay::io::blueprint::write_mesh` that undermined `truncate=true` option for root-only style output.
- Fixed options parsing bugs and improved error messages for the `conduit_blueprint_verify` exe.

#### Relay
- Changed HDF5 offset support to use 64-bit unsigned integers for offsets, strides, and sizes.
- Fixed a bug with `conduit::relay::mpi::io::blueprint::save_mesh` where `file_style=root_only` could crash or truncate output files.
- Fixed a bug with inconsistent HDF5 handles being used in some cases when converting existing HDF5 Datasets from fixed to extendable.


## [0.7.2] - Released 2021-05-19

### Added

#### General
- Added the `cpp_fort_and_py` standalone example. It demos passing Conduit Nodes between C++, Fortran, and Python. See the related tutorial docs (https://llnl-conduit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_cpp_fort_and_py.html) for more details.
- Added  `conduit::utils::info_handler()`, `conduit::utils::warning_handler()`, and `conduit::utils::error_handler()`  methods, which provide access to the currently registered info, warning, and error handlers.
- Added DataType::index_t method. Creates a DataType instance that describes an `index_t`, which is an alias to either `int32`, or `int 64` controlled by the `CONDUIT_INDEX_32` compile time option.
- Added several more methods to Python DataType interface
- Removed duplicate install of CMake exported target files that served as a bridge for clients using old style paths.

### Changed

#### General
- Updated to newer version of uberenv and changed to track spack fork https://github.com/alpine-dav/spack (branch: conduit/develop).
- Updated to newer version of BLT to leverage CMake's FindMPI defined targets when using CMake 3.15 or newer.
- Changed `rapidjson` namespace to `conduit_rapidjson` to avoid symbol collisions with other libraries using RapidJSON.

#### Blueprint
- The semantics of `conduit::blueprint::mesh::verify` changed. An empty conduit Node is now considered a valid multi-domain mesh with zero domains. If you always expect mesh data, you can add an additional check for empty to craft code that works for both the old and new verify semantics.

#### Relay
- Added Relay HDF5 support for reading and writing to an HDF5 dataset with offset.
- Added `conduit::relay::io::hdf5::read_info` which allows you to obtain metadata from an HDF5 file.
- Added configure error when conduit lacks MPI support and HDF5 has MPI support

### Fixed

#### General
- Fixed missing implementation of DataType::is_index_t
- Fixed issue with compiling t_h5z_zfp_smoke.cpp against an MPI-enabled HDF5.

#### Blueprint
- Fixed a bug that caused HDF5 reference paths to appear twice in Relay HDF5 Error messages.

#### Blueprint
- `conduit::relay::io::blueprint.read_mesh` now uses read only I/O handles.


## [0.7.1] - Released 2021-02-11

### Fixed

#### General
- Fixed a bug with Conduit's C interface including C++ headers.

#### Blueprint
- Fixed a bug with `blueprint::mesh::matset::to_silo` and `blueprint::mesh::field::to_silo` that could modify input values.

## [0.7.0] - Released 2021-02-08

### Changed

#### General
- Conduit now requires C++11 support.
- Python Node repr string construction now uses `Node.to_summary_string()`

### Added
- CMake: Added extra check for include dir vs fully resolved hdf5 path.

#### General
- Added a builtin sandboxed header-only version of fmt. The namespace and directory paths were changed to `conduit_fmt` to avoid potential symbol collisions with other codes using fmt. Downstream software can use by including `conduit_fmt/conduit_fmt.h`.
- Added support for using C++11 initializer lists to set Node and DataArray values from numeric arrays. See C++ tutorial docs (https://llnl-conduit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_cpp_numeric.html#c-11-initializer-lists) for more details.
- Added a Node::describe() method. This method creates a new node that mirrors the current Node, however each leaf is replaced by summary stats and a truncated display of the values. For use cases with large leaves, printing the describe() output Node is much more helpful for debugging and understanding vs wall of text from other to_string() methods.
- Added conduit::utils::format methods. These methods use fmt to format strings that include fmt style patterns. The formatting arguments are passed as a conduit::Node tree. The `args` case allows named arguments (args passed as object) or ordered args (args passed as list). The `maps` case also supports named or ordered args and works in conjunction with a `map_index`. The `map_index` is used to fetch a value from an array, or list of strings, which is then passed to fmt. The `maps` style of indexed indirection supports generating path strings for non-trivial domain partition mappings in Blueprint. This functionality is also available in Python, via the  `conduit.utils.format` method.
- Added `DataArray::fill` method, which set all elements of a DataArray to a given value.
- Added `Node::to_summary_string` methods, which allow you to create truncated strings that describe a node tree, control the max number of children and max number of elements shown.
- Added python support for `Node.to_summary_string`

#### Relay
- Added Relay IO Handle mode support for `a` (append) and `t` (truncate).  Truncate allows you to overwrite files when the handle is opened. The default is append, which preserves prior IO Handle behavior.
- Added `conduit::relay::io::blueprint::save_mesh` variants, these overwrite existing files (providing relay save semantics) instead of adding mesh data to existing files. We recommend using  `save_mesh` for most uses cases, b/c in many cases `write_mesh` to an existing HDF5 file set can fail due to conflicts with the current HDF5 tree.
- Added `conduit::relay::io::blueprint::load_mesh` variants, these reset the passed node before reading mesh data (providing relay load semantics). We recommend using  `load_mesh` for most uses cases.
- Added `truncate` option to `conduit::relay::io::blueprint::write_mesh`, this is used by `save_mesh`.
- Improve capture and reporting of I/O errors in `conduit::relay::[mpi::]io::blueprint::{save_mesh|write_mesh}`. Now in the MPI case, If any rank fails to open or write to a file all ranks will throw an exception.
- Added yaml detection support to `conduit::relay::io:identify_file_type`.

#### Blueprint
- Added `conduit::blueprint::mesh::matset::to_silo()` which converts a valid blueprint matset to a node that contains arrays that follow Silo's sparse mix slot volume fraction representation.
- Added `conduit::blueprint::mesh::field::to_silo()` which converts a valid blueprint field and matset to a node that contains arrays that follow Silo's sparse mix slot volume fraction representation.
- Added `material_map` to `conduit::blueprint::mesh:matset::index`, to provide an explicit material name to id mapping.
- Added `mat_check` field to `blueprint::mesh::examples::venn`. This field encodes the material info in a scalar field and in the `matset_values` in a way that can be used to easily compare and verify proper construction in other tools.

### Fixed

#### Relay
- Fixed bug in the Relay IOHandle Basic that would create unnecessary "_json" schema files to be written to disk upon open().

### Removed

#### General
- Removed `Node::fetch_child` and `Schema::fetch_child` methods for v0.7.0. (Deprecated in v0.6.0 -- prefer `fetch_existing`)
- Removed `Schema::to_json` method variants with `detailed` for v0.7.0. (Deprecated in v0.6.0 -- prefer standard `to_json`)
- Removed `Schema::save` method variant with `detailed` for v0.7.0. (Deprecated in v0.6.0 -- prefer standard `save`)
- The `master` branch was removed from GitHub (Deprecated in v0.6.0 -- replaced by the `develop` branch)

#### Relay
- Removed `conduit::relay::io_blueprint::save` methods for v0.7.0. (Deprecated in v0.6.0 -- prefer `conduit::relay::io::blueprint::save_mesh`)


## [0.6.0] - Released 2020-11-02

### Added

#### General
- Added support for children with names that include `/`. Since slashes are part of Conduit's hierarchical path mechanism, you must use explicit methods (add_child(), child(), etc) to create and access children with these types of names. These names are also supported in all basic i/o cases (JSON, YAML, Conduit Binary).
- Added Node::child and Schema::child methods, which provide access to existing children by name.
- Added Node::fetch_existing and Schema::fetch_existing methods, which provide access to existing paths or error when given a bad path.
- Added Node::add_child() and Node::remove_child() to support direct operations and cases where names have `/` s.
- Added a set of conduit::utils::log::remove_* filtering functions, which process conduit log/info nodes and strip out the requested information (useful for focusing the often verbose output in log/info nodes).
- Added to_string() and to_string_default() methods to Node, Schema, DataType, and DataArray. These methods alias either to_yaml() or to_json(). Long term yaml will be preferred over json.
- Added helper script (scripts/regen_docs_outputs.py) that regenerates all example outputs used Conduit's Sphinx docs.
- Added to_yaml() and to_yaml_stream methods() to Schema, DataType, and DataArray.
- Added support for C++-style iterators on node children. You can now do `for (Node &node : node.children()) {}`. You can also do `node.children.begin()` and `node.children.end()` to work with the iterators directly.

#### Relay
- Added an open mode option to Relay IOHandle. See Relay IOHandle docs (https://llnl-conduit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/relay_io.html#relay-i-o-handle-interface) for more details.
- Added the conduit.relay.mpi Python module to support Relay MPI in Python.
- Added support to write and read Conduit lists to HDF5 files. Since HDF5 Groups do not support unnamed indexed children, each list child is written using a string name that represents its index and a special attribute is written to the HDF5 group to mark the list case. On read, the special attribute is used to detect and read this style of group back into a Conduit list.
- Added preliminary support to read Sidre Datastore-style HDF5 using Relay IOHandle,  those grouped with a root file.
- Added `conduit::relay::io::blueprint::read_mesh` functions, were pulled in from Ascent's Blueprint import logic.
- Added `conduit::relay::mpi::wait` and `conduit::relay::mpi::wait_all` functions. These functions consolidate the logic supporting both `isend` and `irecv` requests. `wait_all` supports cases where both sends and receives were posted, which is a common for non-trivial point-to-point communication use cases.


#### Blueprint
- Added support for sparse one-to-many relationships with the new `blueprint::o2mrelation` protocol. See the `blueprint::o2mrelation::examples::uniform` example for details.
- Added sparse one-to-many, uni-buffer, and material-dominant specification support to Material sets. See the Material sets documentation
(https://llnl-conduit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blueprint_mesh.html#material-sets) for more details.
- Added support for Adjacency sets for Structured Mesh Topologies. See the `blueprint::mesh::examples::adjset_uniform` example.
- Added `blueprint::mesh::examples::julia_nestsets_simple` and `blueprint::mesh::examples::julia_nestsets_complex` examples represent Julia set fractals using patch-based AMR meshes and the Mesh Blueprint Nesting Set protocol. See the Julia AMR Blueprint docs
(https://llnl-conduit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blueprint_mesh.html#julia-amr-examples) for more details.
- Added `blueprint::mesh::examples::venn` example that demonstrates different ways to encode volume fraction based multi-material fields.  See the Venn Blueprint docs
(https://llnl-conduit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blueprint_mesh.html#venn) for more details.
- Added `blueprint::mesh::number_of_domains` property method for trees that conform to the mesh blueprint.
- Added MPI mesh blueprint methods, `blueprint::mpi::mesh::verify` and  `blueprint::mpi::mesh::number_of_domains` (available in the `conduit_blueprint_mpi` library)
- Added `blueprint::mpi::mesh::examples::braid_uniform_multi_domain` and `blueprint::mpi::mesh::examples::spiral_round_robin` distributed-memory mesh examples to the `conduit_blueprint_mpi` library.
- Added `state/path` to the Mesh Blueprint index, needed for consumers to know the proper path to read extended state info (such as `domain_id`)


### Fixed

#### General
- Updated to newer BLT to resolve BLT/FindMPI issues with rpath linking commands when using OpenMPI.
- Fixed internal object name string for the Python Iterator object. It used to report `Schema`, which triggered both puzzling and concerned emotions.
- Fixed a bug with `Node.set` in the Python API that undermined setting NumPy arrays with sliced views and complex striding. General slices should now work with `set`. No changes to the `set_external` case, which requires 1-D effective striding and throws an exception when more complex strides are presented.
- Fixed a bug with auto detect of protocol for Node.load
- Fixed bugs with auto detect of protocol for Node.load and Node.save in the Python interface


#### Relay
- Use H5F_ACC_RDONLY in relay::io::is_hdf5_file to avoid errors when checking files that already have open HDF5 handles.
- Fixed compatibility check for empty Nodes against HDF5 files with existing paths

### Changed

#### General
- Conduit's main git branch was renamed from `master` to `develop`. To allow time for folks to migrate, the `master` branch is active but frozen and will be removed during the `0.7.0` release.
- We recommend a C++11 (or newer) compiler, support for older C++ standards is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
- Node::fetch_child and Schema::fetch_child are deprecated in favor of the more clearly named Node::fetch_existing and Schema::fetch_existing. fetch_child variants still exist, but will be removed in a future release.
- Python str() methods for Node, Schema, and DataType now use their new to_string() methods.
- DataArray<T>::to_json(std::ostring &) is deprecated in favor DataArray<T>::to_json_stream. to_json(std::ostring &) will be removed in a future release.
- Schema::to_json and Schema::save variants with detailed (bool) arg are deprecated. The detailed arg was never used. These methods will be removed in a future release.
- Node::print() now prints yaml instead of json.
- The string return variants of `about` methods now return yaml strings instead of json strings.
- Sphinx Docs code examples and outputs are now included using start-after and end-before style includes.
- Schema to_json() and to_json_stream() methods were expanded to support indent, depth, pad and end-of-element args.
- In Python, conduit.Node() repr now returns the YAML string representation of the Node. Perviously verbose `conduit_json` was used, which was overwhelming.
- conduit.about() now reports the git tag if found, and `version` was changed to add git sha and status (dirty) info to avoid confusion between release and development installs.

#### Relay
- Provide more context when a Conduit Node cannot be written to a HDF5 file because it is incompatible with the existing HDF5 tree. Error messages now provide the full path and details about the incompatibility.
- `conduit::relay::io_blueprint::save` functions are deprecated in favor of `conduit::relay::io::blueprint::write_mesh`
- `conduit::relay::io::blueprint::write_mesh` functions were pulled in from Ascent's Blueprint export logic.
- `conduit_relay_io_mpi` lib now depends on `conduit_relay_io`. Due to this change, a single build supports either ADIOS serial (no-mpi) or ADIOS with MPI support, but not both. If conduit is configured with MPI support, ADIOS MPI is used.
- The functions `conduit::relay::mpi::wait_send` and `conduit::relay::mpi::wait_recv` now use `conduit::relay::mpi::wait`. The functions `wait_send` and `wait_recv` exist to preserve the old API, there is no benefit to use them over `wait`.
- The functions `conduit::relay::mpi::wait_all_send` and `conduit::relay::mpi::wait_all_recv` now use `conduit::relay::mpi::wait_all`. The functions `wait_all_send` and `wait_all_recv` exist to preserve the old API, there is no benefit to use them over `wait_all`.


#### Blueprint
- Refactored the Polygonal and Polyhedral mesh blueprint specification to leverage one-to-many concepts and to allow more zero-copy use cases.
- The `conduit_blueprint_mpi` library now depends on `conduit_relay_mpi`.
- The optional Mesh Blueprint structured topology logical element origin is now specified using `{i,j,k}` instead of `{i0,j0,k0}`.

For other protocols, they will behave the same as the serial functions in relay::io. For the ADIOS protocol, the save() and save_merged() functions operate collectively within a communicator to enable multiple MPI ranks to save data to a single file as separate "domains".
- Added an add_time_step() function to that lets the caller append data collectively to an existing  ADIOS file
- Added a function to query the number of time steps and the number of domains in a  ADIOS file.
