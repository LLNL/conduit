# This file is named ConduitConfig.cmake because once upon a time
# when it was named conduit-config.cmake, we found that CMake's exported
# targets script includes all "ascent-*.cmake" files. This logic would
# cause this script to be included more than once, seeding instability
# that caused great harm to the kingdom.
