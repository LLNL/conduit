Using *Generator* instances to parse JSON schemas
---------------------------------------------------

The *Generator* class is used to parse conduit JSON schemas into a *Node*.


.. # from t_conduit_docs_tutorial_python_json: json_generator_std

.. literalinclude:: ../../tests/docs/t_conduit_docs_tutorial_python_json.py
   :lines: 62-67
   :language: python
   :dedent: 8

.. literalinclude:: t_conduit_docs_python_tutorial_json_out.txt
   :lines: 29-32
   :dedent: 4


The *Generator* can also parse pure json. For leaf nodes: wide types such as *int64*, *uint64*, and *float64* are inferred.
