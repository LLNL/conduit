Relay
===================

.. note::
    The **relay** APIs and docs are work in progress.


Conduit Relay is an umbrella project for I/O and communication functionality built on top of Conduit's Core API. It includes three components:

* **io** - I/O functionally beyond binary, memory mapped, and json-based text file I/O. Includes optional Silo and HDF5 I/O support. 
* **web** - An embedded web server (built using `CivetWeb <https://github.com/civetweb/civetweb>`_) that can host files and supports developing custom REST and WebSocket backends that use conduit::Node instances as payloads.
* **mpi**  - Interfaces for MPI communication using conduit::Node instances as payloads.

The **io** and **web** features are built into the *conduit_relay* library. The MPI functionality exists in a separate library *conduit_relay_mpi* to avoid include and linking issues for serial codes that want to use relay.
