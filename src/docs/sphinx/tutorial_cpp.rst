C++ Tutorial
======================

This short tutorial provides C++ examples that demonstrate the Conduit's Core 
API. Conduit's unit tests (*src/tests/{library_name}/*) also provide a rich set 
of examples for Conduit's Core API and additional libraries. 
Ascent's Tutorial also provides a brief `intro to Conduit basics <https://ascent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Tutorial_Intro_Conduit_Basics.html>`_
with C++ and Python examples.
