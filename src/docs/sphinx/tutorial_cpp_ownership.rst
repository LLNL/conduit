Data Ownership
============================================

The *Node* class provides two ways to hold data, the data is either **owned** or **externally described**:

- If a *Node* **owns** data, the *Node* allocated the memory holding the data and is responsible or deallocating it. 
-  If a *Node* **externally describes** data, the *Node* holds a pointer to the memory where the data resides and is not responsible for deallocating it. 

*set* vs *set_external* 
--------------------------------

The **Node::set** methods support creating **owned** data and copying data values in both the **owned** and **externally described** cases. The **Node::set_external** methods allow you to create **externally described** data:

- **set(...)**: Makes a copy of the data passed into the *Node*. This will trigger an allocation if the current data type of the *Node* is incompatible with what was passed. The *Node* assignment operators use their respective **set** variants, so they follow the same copy semantics. 

- **set_external(...)**: Sets up the *Node* to describe data passed and access the data externally. Does not copy the data.
