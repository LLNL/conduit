Protocol
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The Blueprint protocol defines a single-domain computational mesh using one or more Coordinate Sets (via child ``coordsets``), one or more Topologies (via child  ``topologies``), zero or more Materials Sets (via child ``matsets``), zero or more Fields (via child ``fields``), optional Adjacency Set information (via child ``adjsets``), and optional State information (via child ``state``).
The protocol defines multi-domain meshes as *Objects* that contain one or more single-domain mesh entries.
For simplicity, the descriptions below are structured relative to a single-domain mesh *Object* that contains one Coordinate Set named ``coords``, one Topology named ``topo``, and one Material Set named ``matset``.


Coordinate Sets
++++++++++++++++++++

To define a computational mesh, the first required entry is a set of spatial coordinate tuples that can underpin a mesh topology.

The mesh blueprint protocol supports sets of spatial coordinates from three coordinate systems:

* Cartesian: {x,y,z}
* Cylindrical: {r,z}
* Spherical: {r,theta,phi}

The mesh blueprint protocol supports three types of Coordinate Sets: ``uniform``, ``rectilinear``, and ``explicit``.  To conform to the protocol, each entry under ``coordsets`` must be an *Object* with entries from one of the cases outlined below: 

* **uniform**

   An implicit coordinate set defined as the cartesian product of i,j,k dimensions starting at an ``origin`` (ex: {x,y,z}) using a given ``spacing`` (ex: {dx,dy,dz}).

  * Cartesian
  
  
    * coordsets/coords/type: “uniform”
    * coordsets/coords/dims/{i,j,k}
    * coordsets/coords/origin/{x,y,z} (optional, default = {0.0, 0.0, 0.0})
    * coordsets/coords/spacing/{dx,dy,dz} (optional, default = {1.0, 1.0, 1.0})


  * Cylindrical
  
  
    * coordsets/coords/type: “uniform”
    * coordsets/coords/dims/{i,j}
    * coordsets/coords/origin/{r,z} (optional, default = {0.0, 0.0})
    * coordsets/coords/spacing/{dr,dz} (optional, default = {1.0, 1.0})


  * Spherical
  
  
    * coordsets/coords/type: “uniform”
    * coordsets/coords/dims/{i,j}
    * coordsets/coords/origin/{r,theta,phi} (optional, default = {0.0, 0.0, 0.0})
    * coordsets/coords/spacing/{dr,dtheta, dphi} (optional, default = {1.0, 1.0, 1.0})


* **rectilinear** 

  An implicit coordinate set defined as the cartesian product of passed coordinate arrays.
  
  * Cartesian
  
  
    * coordsets/coords/type: “rectilinear”
    * coordsets/coords/values/{x,y,z}

  * Cylindrical:
  
    * coordsets/coords/type: “rectilinear”
    * coordsets/coords/values/{r,z}

  * Spherical


    * coordsets/coords/type: “rectilinear”
    * coordsets/coords/values/{r,theta,phi}


* **explicit**

  An explicit set of coordinates, which includes ``values`` that conforms to the  **mcarray** blueprint protocol.

  * Cartesian
  
  
    * coordsets/coords/type: “explicit”
    * coordsets/coords/values/{x,y,z}

  * Cylindrical
  
  
    * coordsets/coords/type: “explicit”
    * coordsets/coords/values/{r,z}

  * Spherical
  
  
    * coordsets/coords/type: “explicit”
    * coordsets/coords/values/{r,theta,phi}


Toplogies
++++++++++++++++++++
The next entry required to describe a computational mesh is its topology. To conform to the protocol, each entry under *topologies* must be an *Object* that contains one of the topology descriptions outlined below.


Topology Nomenclature 
====================================

The mesh blueprint protocol describes meshes in terms of ``vertices``, ``edges``, ``faces``, and ``elements``.

The following element shape names are supported:

====== ================  ===================================================
Name    Geometric Type    Specified By 
====== ================  ===================================================
point   point             an index to a single coordinate tuple
line    line              indices to 2 coordinate tuples
tri     triangle          indices to 3 coordinate tuples
quad    quadrilateral     indices to 4 coordinate tuples
tet     tetrahedron       indices to 4 coordinate tuples
hex     hexahedron        indices to 8 coordinate tuples
====== ================  ===================================================

.. note
   
   The expected index ordering with in an element (also referred to as a winding order) is not specified by the blueprint. 
   In the future, we plan to provide transforms to help convert between orderings, are not likely to specify specific orderings.

.. * future: polygon, polyhedron

Association with a Coordinate Set
====================================

Each topology entry must have a child ``coordset`` with a string that references a valid coordinate set by name.

    * topologies/topo/coordset: "coords"


Optional association with a Grid Function
==========================================

Topologies can optionally include a child ``grid_function`` with a string that references a valid field by name.

    * topologies/topo/grid_function: "gf"


Implicit Topology
===============================

The mesh blueprint protocol accepts four implicit ways to define a topology on a coordinate set. The first simply uses all the points in a given coordinate set and the rest define grids of elements on top of a coordinate set. For the grid cases with a coordinate set with 1D coordinate tuples, *line* elements are used, for sets with 2D coordinate tuples *quad* elements are used, and for 3D coordinate tuples *hex* elements are used.

* **points**: An implicit topology using all of the points in a coordinate set. 
   
   * topologies/topo/coordset: "coords"
   * topologies/topo/type: "points"

* **uniform**: An implicit topology that defines a grid of elements on top of a *uniform* coordinate set. 
   
   * topologies/topo/coordset: "coords"
   * topologies/topo/type: “uniform”
   * topologies/topo/elements/origin/{i0,j0,k0} (optional, default = {0,0,0})
   
* **rectilinear**: An implicit topology that defines a grid of elements on top of a *rectilinear* coordinate set. 
   
   * topologies/topo/coordset: "coords"
   * topologies/topo/type: “rectilinear”
   * topologies/topo/elements/origin/{i0,j0,k0} (optional, default = {0,0,0})
  

.. .. attention::
..    (can we collapse uniform + rectilinear?)
.. * topologies/topo/type: “structured”
.. * topologies/topo/elements/dims: "implicit"
.. * topologies/topo/elements/origin/{i0,j0,k0} (optional, default = {0,0,0})
.. * topologies/coordset: "coords"


* **structured**: An implicit topology that defines a grid of elements on top of an *explicit* coordinate set.
  
  * topologies/topo/coordset: "coords"
  * topologies/topo/type = “structured”
  * topologies/topo/elements/dims/{i,j,k}
  * topologies/topo/elements/origin/{i0,j0,k0} (optional, default = {0,0,0})



Explicit (Unstructured) Topology
=================================


Single Shape Topology
************************

For topologies using a homogenous collection of element shapes (eg: all hexs), the topology can be specified by 
a connectivity array and a shape name.

  * topologies/topo/coordset: "coords"
  * topologies/topo/type: “unstructured”
  * topologies/topo/elements/shape: (shape name)
  * topologies/topo/elements/connectivity: (index array)



Mixed Shape Toplogies 
************************

For topologies using a non-homogenous collections of element shapes (eg: hexs and texs), the topology can 
specified using a single shape topology for each element shape.

* **list** - A Node in the *List* role, that contains a children that conform to the *Single Shape Topology* case. 

* **object** - A Node in the *Object* role, that contains a children that conform to the *Single Shape Topology* case. 

.. note::
   Future version of the mesh blueprint will expand support to include mixed elements types in a single array with related
   index arrays.


Element Windings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The mesh blueprint does yet not have a prescribed winding convention (a way to order the association of vertices to elements) or more generally to 
outline a topology's `dimensional cascade`  (how elements are related to faces, faces are related to edges, and edges are related to vertices. )

This is a gap we are working to solve in future versions of the mesh blueprint, with a goal of providing transforms to
help convert between different winding or cascade schemes.

That said VTK (and VTK-m) winding conventions are assumed by MFEM, VisIt, or Ascent when using Blueprint data.

..   (specifying stream ids and stream connectivity)
..

..   * topologies/topo/elements/stream: ()
..

..     * topology/elements/segment_index/stream_ids: ()
..     * topology/elements/segment_index/element_counts: ()
..     * topology/elements/stream: ()

Material Sets
++++++++++++++++++++

Materials Sets contain material name and volume fraction information defined over a specified mesh topology.

A material set contains an **mcarray** that houses per-material, per-element volume fractions and a source topology over which these volume fractions are defined.
To conform to protocol, each entry in the ``matsets`` section must be an *Object* that contains the following information:

   * matsets/matset/topology: "topo"
   * matsets/matset/volume_fractions: (mcarray)



Fields
++++++++++++++++++++

Fields are used to hold simulation state arrays associated with a mesh topology and (optionally) a mesh material set.

Each field entry can define an **mcarray** of material-independent values and/or an **mcarray** of per-material values.
These data arrays must be specified alongside a source space, which specifies the space over which the field values are defined (i.e. a topology for material-independent values and a material set for material-dependent values).
Minimally, each field entry must specify one of these data sets, the source space for the data set, an association type (e.g. per-vertex, per-element, or per-grid-function-entity), and a volume scaling type (e.g. volume-dependent, volume-independent).
Thus, to conform to protocol, each entry under the ``fields`` section must be an *Object* that adheres to one of the following descriptions:

 * Material-Independent Fields:

   * fields/field/association: "vertex" | "element" 
   * fields/field/grid_function: (mfem-style finite element collection name) (replaces "association")
   * fields/field/volume_dependent: "true" | "false"
   * fields/field/topology: "topo"
   * fields/field/values: (mcarray)

 * Material-Dependent Fields:

   * fields/field/association: "vertex" | "element"
   * fields/field/grid_function: (mfem-style finite element collection name) (replaces "association")
   * fields/field/volume_dependent: "true" | "false"
   * fields/field/matset: "matset"
   * fields/field/matset_values: (mcarray)

 * Mixed Fields:

   * fields/field/association: "vertex" | "element"
   * fields/field/grid_function: (mfem-style finite element collection name) (replaces "association")
   * fields/field/volume_dependent: "true" | "false"
   * fields/field/topology: "topo"
   * fields/field/values: (mcarray)
   * fields/field/matset: "matset"
   * fields/field/matset_values: (mcarray)




Topology Association for Field Values
======================================

For implicit topologies, the field values are associated with the topology by fast varying logical dimensions starting with ``i``, then ``j``, then ``k``.

For explicit topologies, the field values are associated with the topology by assuming the order of the field values matches the order the elements are defined in the topology. 


Adjacency Sets
++++++++++++++++++++

Adjacency Sets are used to outline the shared geometry between subsets of domains in multi-domain meshes.

Each entry in the Adjacency Sets section is meant to encapsulate a set of adjacency information shared between domains.
Each individual adjacency set contains a source topology, an element association, and a list of adjacency groups.
An adjacency set's contained groups describe adjacency information shared between subsets of domains, which is represented by a subset of adjacent neighbor domains IDs and a list of shared element IDs.
The fully-defined Blueprint schema for the ``adjsets`` entries looks like the following:

   * adjsets/adjset/association: "vertex" | "element"
   * adjsets/adjset/topology: "topo"
   * adjsets/adjset/groups/group/neighbors: (integer array)
   * adjsets/adjset/groups/group/values: (integer array)



State
++++++++++++++++++++

Optional state information is used to provide metadata about the mesh. While the mesh blueprint is focused on describing a single domain of a domain decomposed mesh, the state info can be used to identify a specific mesh domain in the context of a domain decomposed mesh.

To conform, the ``state`` entry must be an *Object* and can have the following optional entries:

   * state/time: (number)
   * state/cycle: (number)
   * state/domain_id: (integer)


Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In C++, the ``conduit::blueprint::mesh::examples`` namespace and in Python the `conduit.blueprint.mesh.examples` module provide
functions that generate example mesh blueprint data. For details on how to write these data sets to files, see the unit tests that exercise these examples in ``src/tests/blueprint/t_blueprint_mesh_examples.cpp``. This section outlines ``braid``, ``sprial``, and ``julia`` examples.
