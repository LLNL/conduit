Protocol
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The mesh blueprint protocol defines a computational mesh using one or more Coordinate Sets (via child ``coordsets``), one or more Topologies (via child  ``topologies``), zero or more Fields (via child ``fields``), and optional State information (via child ``state``). For simplicity, the descriptions below outline one Coordinate Set named ``coords`` one Topology named ``topo``.



Coordinate Sets
++++++++++++++++++++

To define a computational mesh, the first required entry is a set of spatial coordinate tuples that can underpin a mesh topology.

The mesh blueprint protocol supports sets of spatial coordinates from three coordinate systems:

* Cartesian: {x,y,z}
* Cylindrical: {r,z}
* Spherical: {r,theta,phi}

The mesh blueprint protocol supports three types of Coordinate Sets: ``uniform``, ``rectilinear``, and ``explicit``.  To conform to the protocol, each entry under ``coordsets`` must be an *Object* with entries from one of the cases outlined below: 

* **uniform**

   An implicit coordinate set defined as the cartesian product of i,j,k dimensions starting at an ``origin`` (ex: {x,y,z}) using a given ``spacing`` (ex: {dx,dy,dz}).

  * Cartesian
  
  
    * coordsets/coords/type: “uniform”
    * coordsets/coords/dims/{i,j,k}
    * coordsets/coords/origin/{x,y,z} (optional, default = {0.0, 0.0, 0.0})
    * coordsets/coords/spacing/{dx,dy,dz} (optional, default = {1.0, 1.0, 1.0})


  * Cylindrical
  
  
    * coordsets/coords/type: “uniform”
    * coordsets/coords/dims/{i,j}
    * coordsets/coords/origin/{r,z} (optional, default = {0.0, 0.0})
    * coordsets/coords/spacing/{dr,dz} (optional, default = {1.0, 1.0})


  * Spherical
  
  
    * coordsets/coords/type: “uniform”
    * coordsets/coords/dims/{i,j}
    * coordsets/coords/origin/{r,theta,phi} (optional, default = {0.0, 0.0, 0.0})
    * coordsets/coords/spacing/{dr,dtheta, dphi} (optional, default = {1.0, 1.0, 1.0})


* **rectilinear** 

  An implicit coordinate set defined as the cartesian product of passed coordinate arrays.
  
  * Cartesian
  
  
    * coordsets/coords/type: “rectilinear”
    * coordsets/coords/values/{x,y,z}

  * Cylindrical:
  
    * coordsets/coords/type: “rectilinear”
    * coordsets/coords/values/{r,z}

  * Spherical


    * coordsets/coords/type: “uniform”
    * coordsets/coords/values/{r,theta,phi}


* **explicit**

  An explicit set of coordinates, which includes ``values`` that conforms to the  **mcarray** blueprint protocol.

  * Cartesian
  
  
    * coordsets/coords/type: “explicit”
    * coordsets/coords/values/{x,y,z}

  * Cylindrical
  
  
    * coordsets/coords/type: “explicit”
    * coordsets/coords/values/{r,z}

  * Spherical
  
  
    * coordsets/coords/type: “explicit”
    * coordsets/coords/values/{r,theta,phi}


Toplogies
++++++++++++++++++++
The next entry required to describe a computational mesh is its topology. To conform to the protocol, each entry under *topologies* must be an *Object* that contains one of the topology descriptions outlined below.


Topology Nomenclature 
====================================

The mesh blueprint protocol describes meshes in terms of ``vertices``, ``edges``, ``faces``, and ``elements``.

The following element shape names are supported:

====== ================  ===================================================
Name    Geometric Type    Specified By 
====== ================  ===================================================
point   point             an index to a single coordinate tuple
line    line              indices to 2 coordinate tuples
tri     triangle          indices to 3 coordinate tuples
quad    quadrilateral     indices to 4 coordinate tuples
tet     tetrahedron       indices to 4 coordinate tuples
hex     hexahedron        indices to 8 coordinate tuples
====== ================  ===================================================

.. note
   
   The expected index ordering with in an element (also referred to as a winding order) is not specified by the blueprint. 
   In the future, we plan to provide transforms to help convert between orderings, are not likely to specify specific orderings.

.. * future: polygon, polyhedron

Association with a Coordinate Set
====================================

Each topology entry must have a child ``coordset`` with a string that references a valid coordinate set by name.

    * topologies/topo/coordset: "coords"


Optional association with a Grid Function
==========================================

Topologies can optionally include a child ``grid_function`` with a string that references a valid field by name.

    * topologies/topo/grid_function: "gf"


Implicit Topology
===============================

The mesh blueprint protocol accepts three implicit ways to define a grid of elements on top of a coordinate set. For coordinate set with 1D coordinate tuples, *line* elements are used, for sets with 2D coordinate tuples *quad* elements are used, and for 3D coordinate tuples *hex* elements are used.


* **uniform**: An implicit topology that defines a grid of elements on top of a *uniform* coordinate set. 
   
   * topologies/topo/coordset: "coords"
   * topologies/topo/type: “uniform”
   * topologies/topo/elements/origin/{i0,j0,k0} (optional, default = {0,0,0})
   
* **rectilinear**: An implicit topology that defines a grid of elements on top of a *rectilinear* coordinate set. 
   
   * topologies/topo/coordset: "coords"
   * topologies/topo/type: “rectilinear”
   * topologies/topo/elements/origin/{i0,j0,k0} (optional, default = {0,0,0})
  

.. .. attention::
..    (can we collapse uniform + rectilinear?)
.. * topologies/topo/type: “structured”
.. * topologies/topo/elements/dims: "implicit"
.. * topologies/topo/elements/origin/{i0,j0,k0} (optional, default = {0,0,0})
.. * topologies/coordset: "coords"


* **structured**: An implicit topology that defines a grid of elements on top of an *explicit* coordinate set.
  
  * topologies/topo/coordset: "coords"
  * topologies/topo/type = “structured”
  * topologies/topo/elements/dims/{i,j,k}
  * topologies/topo/elements/origin/{i0,j0,k0} (optional, default = {0,0,0})



Explicit (Unstructured) Topology
=================================


Single Shape Topology
************************

For topologies using a homogenous collection of element shapes (eg: all hexs), the topology can be specified by 
a connectivity array and a shape name.

  * topologies/topo/coordset: "coords"
  * topologies/topo/type: “unstructured”
  * topologies/topo/elements/shape: (shape name)
  * topologies/topo/elements/connectivity: (index array)



Mixed Shape Toplogies 
************************

For topologies using a non-homogenous collections of element shapes (eg: hexs and texs), the topology can 
specified using a single shape topology for each element shape.

* **list** - A Node in the *List* role, that contains a children that conform to the *Single Shape Topology* case. 

* **object** - A Node in the *Object* role, that contains a children that conform to the *Single Shape Topology* case. 

.. note::
   Future version of the mesh blueprint will expand support to include mixed elements types in a single array with related
   index arrays.

.. * **stream** - (strem description)
..   (specifying stream ids and stream connectivity)
..
..
..   * topologies/topo/elements/element_types: ()
..   * topologies/topo/elements/stream: ()
..
.. Indexed Streams
.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
..
.. * Stream of Indexed Elements
..
..
..     * topology/elements/element_types: ()
..     * topology/elements/element_index/stream_ids: ()
..     * topology/elements/element_index/offsets: ()
..     * topology/elements/stream: ()
..
.. * Stream of Contiguous Segments of Element Types
..
..
..     * topology/elements/element_types: ()
..     * topology/elements/segment_index/stream_ids: ()
..     * topology/elements/segment_index/element_counts: ()
..     * topology/elements/stream: ()

Fields
++++++++++++++++++++

Fields are used to hold simulation state arrays associated with a mesh topology.


A field contains an **mcarray** and information about how this data is associated with elements of the topology. 
To conform to the protocol, each entry under ``fields`` must be an *Object* that contains one of these two styles of field descriptions:

 * Standard Fields:

   * fields/den/topology: "topo" 
   * fields/den/association: “vertex” | "element"
   * fields/den/values: (mcarray)


 * High Order Fields:

   * fields/den/topology: "topo"
   * fields/den/basis: (a string that includes an mfem-style finite element collection name)
   * fields/den/values: (mcarray)



State
++++++++++++++++++++

Optional state information is used to provide metadata about the mesh. While the mesh blueprint is focused on describing a single domain of a domain decomposed mesh, the state info can be used to identify a specific mesh domain in the context of a domain decomposed mesh.

To conform, the ``state`` entry must be an *Object* and can have the following optional entries:

   * state/time: (number)
   * state/cycle: (number)
   * state/number_of_domains: (integer)
   * state/domain_id: (integer)


Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The mesh blueprint namespace includes a function *braid()*, that generates examples 
that cover the range of coordinate sets and topologies supported.

The example datasets include a vertex-centered scalar field ``braid``, an element-centered scalar field ``radial`` and
as a vertex-centered vector field ``vel``.

.. code:: cpp

    conduit::blueprint::mesh::examples::braid(const std::string &mesh_type,
                                              index_t nx,
                                              index_t ny,
                                              index_t nz,
                                              Node &out);

+---------------+-----------------------------------------------+

*nx,ny,nz* specify the number of elements in the *x,y,z* directions.

*nz* is ignored for 2d-only examples.

The resulting data is placed the Node *out*, which is passed in via a reference.

For more details, see the unit tests that exercise these examples in ``src/tests/blueprint/t_blueprint_mesh_examples.cpp``
